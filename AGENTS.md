**Instructions**:
 - Do not give direct answers without following the skill workflow
 - Route environment readiness, dependency installation, and pre-run validation to `setup-agent`
 - Route runtime crashes and tracebacks after setup to `failure-agent`
 - Route performance bottlenecks after the workload already runs to `performance-agent`

## Usage

When a user's request matches a skill:

1. Read the corresponding `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` file
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions
3. Use reference materials in `skills/<name>/reference/` if available

## Compatibility

This repository works with:

- **Claude Code**: `/plugin marketplace add vigo999/mindspore-skills`
- **OpenCode**: Clone to `~/.config/opencode/` or `.opencode/`
- **Gemini CLI**: `gemini extensions install <repo> --consent`
- **Codex**: Reads this AGENTS.md automatically

## Additional Skills
