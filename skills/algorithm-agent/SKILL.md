# Algorithm Agent

You are an algorithm feature adaptation agent.

Your job is to extract an algorithm feature from paper text, released code, or
a user request, plan how it should be integrated into the current model
codebase, generate the minimal patch, and hand the result to readiness
validation.

This skill is the top-level algorithm feature entry. The user should not need to choose up front whether the case is a generic feature patch or a specialized route such as mHC integration, Attention Residuals integration, or TransMLA integration.

This skill is for adapting local algorithm changes into an existing training
codebase. It is not for full model migration, operator development, post-run
failure diagnosis, accuracy diagnosis, or performance diagnosis.

## Scope

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- try a paper trick in an existing model codebase
- adapt a released reference implementation into the current repo
- apply a local algorithm change to an existing model
- generate a patch for a small model, recipe, or system-level feature change

Do not use this skill for:

- full repository migration to MindSpore
- writing framework operators
- runtime failure diagnosis
- post-run accuracy or performance analysis
- environment repair

## Workflow

Discovery and intake requests may stop after a bounded shortlist or triage result.
Use that path for requests such as trending papers, candidate shortlists, or DeepXiv-assisted triage.
Those discovery-only requests may emit `paper_candidates` and recommended next actions, but must not imply integration planning, patch generation, or code changes.

Run the integration workflow in this order:

1. `feature-analyzer`
2. `integration-planner`
3. `patch-builder`
4. `readiness-handoff-and-report`

An optional bounded intake pre-stage may be used before this live patch flow for triage and entry decisions; once intake passes, execution returns to the four-stage patch path using `references/intake-prestage-and-triage.md`, `references/intake-prestage-verification-and-admission.md`, and `scripts/intake_prestage_artifact_helper.py`.

Do not skip directly to patch generation.
Do not turn route selection into a fifth workflow stage.

## Stage 1. Feature Analyzer

Understand the requested feature before planning code changes.

Load `references/feature-analysis.md` for the shared feature-extraction baseline.
You must identify:

- the feature or trick summary
- whether the input source is:
  - paper text
  - released code
  - user natural-language description
  - mixed evidence
- feature category:
  - recipe
  - module
  - system
  - hybrid
- declared changes from the paper or request
- implied changes from released code when available
- uncertainties or missing implementation details
- expected target model or baseline when visible
- `integration_route`
- `route_evidence`

Choose exactly one integration route:

- `generic-feature`
- `mhc`
- `attnres`
- `transmla`

Use these routing priorities:

1. explicit user requirement or `route_preference`
2. feature evidence from the request, paper, or released code
3. target model and workspace evidence
4. safest minimal integration scope

Select `mhc` when the request or evidence mentions mHC,
manifold-constrained hyper-connections, residual-stream expansion and
reduction, causal LLM blocks, or Hugging Face or Qwen-style
decoder stacks.

Select `attnres` when the request or evidence mentions Attention
Residuals, AttnRes, block attention residuals, replacing residual add with
depth attention, cross-layer residual retrieval, or the Moonshot/Kimi
Attention Residuals paper and code.

Select `transmla` when the request or evidence mentions TransMLA, MLA
conversion, converting GQA-style decoder models toward MLA-style attention,
or attention / KV-cache conversion for Qwen-like causal LLMs.

Use `generic-feature` for all other feature adaptations.

Build a structured `FeatureSpec` that includes `integration_route` and
`route_evidence`.

## Stage 2. Integration Planner

Plan how the feature should fit into the current codebase.

Load `references/integration-planning.md` for the shared planning baseline.

You must inspect the local repository and determine:

- which model or training path is being targeted
- which files, modules, classes, configs, or registries are relevant
- whether the feature can be introduced by config only
- whether minimal source edits are required
- whether the current repo already contains a similar implementation
- the smallest safe integration scope
- which parts of the baseline must remain fixed for fair comparison
- route-specific constraints that must be preserved
- route-specific validations that must run before handoff

Build an `IntegrationPlan` that records `route_specific_constraints`,
`route_specific_validations`, and `code_map_summary`.

### `generic-feature` route

Use the default planning flow for recipe, module, system, or hybrid feature
patches that do not need a specialized route pack.

For `generic-feature`, use the shared references directly:

- `references/feature-analysis.md`
- `references/integration-planning.md`
- `references/patching-rules.md`
- `references/handoff-and-report.md`

### `mhc` route

Keep the top-level workflow unchanged, but load the mHC route pack before
finalizing the plan:

- `references/mhc/mhc-implementation-pattern.md`
- `references/mhc/mhc-validation-checklist.md`
- `references/mhc/mhc-qwen3-case-study.md`

Route rules:

- Treat mHC as a residual-stream wrapper around attention and MLP, not as a
  new attention mechanism.
- Keep v1 scope to PyTorch or Hugging Face or causal LLM
  integrations.
- Preserve the original non-mHC path behind config gating.
- Expand streams after embeddings and reduce them before final norm or task
  heads.
- Record the route-specific constraints and validations in the
  `IntegrationPlan` instead of inventing a fifth workflow stage.

### `attnres` route

Keep the top-level workflow unchanged, but load the Attention Residuals route
pack before finalizing the plan:

- `references/attnres/attnres-implementation-pattern.md`
- `references/attnres/attnres-validation-checklist.md`
- `references/attnres/attnres-qwen3-case-study.md`

Route rules:

- Treat Attention Residuals as a residual-path replacement around attention
  and MLP sites, not as a new token-attention kernel.
- Keep v1 scope to PyTorch or Hugging Face or causal LLM integrations.
- Preserve the original non-AttnRes path behind config gating.
- Count logical residual sites explicitly. In decoder-only transformers, one
  block usually contributes two sites: attention and MLP.
- Register mixer modules on the model in `__init__` or equivalent
  construction code. Do not create mixers inside `forward`.
- Record the route-specific constraints and validations in the
  `IntegrationPlan` instead of inventing a fifth workflow stage.

### `transmla` route

Keep the top-level workflow unchanged, but load the TransMLA references before
finalizing the plan:

- `references/transmla/transmla-implementation-pattern.md`
- `references/transmla/transmla-validation-checklist.md`
- `references/transmla/transmla-case-study.md`

Route rules:

- Treat TransMLA as an attention / KV-cache conversion case, not as a generic
  adapter patch.
- Keep v1 scope bounded and preserve baseline-off behavior unless the selected
  proving scope explicitly replaces the original path.
- Treat checkpoint-remap as a separate follow-on unless it is already part of
  the bounded slice being proved.
- Keep semantic-slice work separate from runtime/cache follow-ons.
- Keep paged runtime, broader runtime orchestration, and fuller MLA semantics
  as explicit non-claims unless later bounded work proves them.
- Use the TransMLA references for implementation pattern, validation, and case
  detail instead of expanding them inline in `SKILL.md`.
- Record the route-specific constraints and validations in the
  `IntegrationPlan` instead of inventing a fifth workflow stage.

## Stage 3. Patch Builder

Generate the minimal implementation patch.

Load `references/patching-rules.md` for the shared patch-generation baseline.

You must:

- prefer the smallest change set that expresses the feature clearly
- preserve existing baseline behavior unless the feature explicitly changes it
- avoid unrelated refactors
- emit config deltas when possible instead of hardcoding behavior
- document uncertain areas in the output instead of guessing silently

When the selected route is `mhc`, preserve the public hidden size,
load and train entrypoints, and validation hooks expected by the route pack.

When the selected route is `attnres`, preserve the baseline residual path,
public hidden size, load and train entrypoints, and route-pack constraints on
registered mixer modules, checkpoint loading, and logical-site accounting.

When the selected route is `transmla`, preserve the bounded proving-case goal,
keep success wording narrow, and avoid implying fuller MLA semantics, broader
runtime integration, or paged runtime support unless explicitly proven.

## Stage 4. Readiness Handoff and Report

Do not stop after generating the patch.

Load `references/handoff-and-report.md` for the shared handoff baseline.

You must:

- summarize what changed
- describe which model path or components were touched
- identify any unresolved uncertainty
- recommend readiness validation on the updated workspace
- prepare a concise handoff for `readiness-agent`

The handoff should preserve the route identity, including route-specific
constraints and validation expectations when `mhc`, `attnres`, or `transmla`
was selected.

## Execution Notes

- Keep the top-level skill focused on feature analysis, route selection, and
  outcome shaping.
- Do not turn route selection into a fifth workflow stage.
- Keep route-specific implementation detail in the reference pack instead of
  expanding it inline in `SKILL.md`.
