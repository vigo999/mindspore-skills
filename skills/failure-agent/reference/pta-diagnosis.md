# PTA Diagnosis Reference

Use this file when stack is `pta` and the failure sits near torch_npu operator
support, ERR codes, device/runtime integration, distributed failures, or
version compatibility.

## Current High-Value Card Matches

- `107002`, `context is empty` -> `ms-context-empty`
- `EL0004`, `200000`, `207018`, `CUDA out of memory` -> `device-out-of-memory`
- `EI0002`, `EI0006`, `107020`, `HCCL` timeout -> `distributed-communication-timeout`
- `symbol not found`, ABI mismatch after upgrade -> `stack-version-mismatch`
- `TBE`, `E9xxxx`, `EBxxxx`, operator compile failure -> `ms-tbe-operator-compilation-error`

## Environment Normalization

Collect these before committing to an operator-level or backend-level root
cause:

- PyTorch version
- torch_npu version
- CANN version
- device placement of the failing tensors
- whether the failure happens in eager op execution, autograd, or a higher-level module path
- whether the failure is single-card or distributed
- whether the visible failure is on the base operator path or only through a wrapper, module, or helper
- whether async execution could be hiding the first real stack frame

If the user only gives a downstream stack, re-run with `ASCEND_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1`
or another blocking mode before blaming registration or ACLNN.

Evidence checklist to normalize early:

1. print the concrete PyTorch, `torch_npu`, and CANN versions
2. print the real device placement of inputs, parameters, and temporary tensors
3. separate eager forward, backward-only, and wrapper or module-only failures
4. separate single-card from distributed execution
5. confirm whether async execution is hiding the first real failure point

## torch_npu ERR Format

Format: `ERR<SubModule><ErrorCode>`

SubModule IDs:

- `00`: PTA core framework
- `01`: operator execution
- `02`: distributed / HCCL
- `03`: graph / compilation
- `04`: profiler

Common error suffixes:

- `001`: invalid parameter
- `002`: invalid type
- `003`: invalid value
- `006`: memory error
- `007`: feature not supported
- `011`: timeout
- `100`: ACL API call failed
- `200`: HCCL API call failed
- `300`: GE API call failed
- `999`: unhandled exception

## Python Exception Types

- `RuntimeError`: runtime, operator, graph, or backend execution failure
- `ValueError`: shape, value, or config validation issue
- `TypeError`: dtype or argument-type mismatch
- `NotImplementedError`: feature or operator not supported on current backend
- `ImportError`: missing shared libs, env setup issue, or version mismatch

## Ascend Runtime and CANN Families

General interpretation:

- `1xxxxx`: environment or logic errors
- `2xxxxx`: resource exhaustion or unsupported feature
- `3xxxxx`: business, queue, or storage class errors
- `5xxxxx`: internal software or hardware fault

Useful runtime families:

- `107xxx`: parameter, context, or runtime control path
- `207xxx`: resource, memory, or feature support path
- `507xxx`: internal, hardware, timeout, or device-health path
- `161xxx`, `361xxx`, `561xxx`: ACLNN parameter, runtime, or internal path
- `E*` alphanumeric codes: TBE, runtime, HCCL, AICPU, profiling, or inner CANN errors

Important direct mappings:

- `107002`: context missing or not initialized
- `107003`: stream not in current context
- `107020`: task timeout
- `207003`: AI Core overflow
- `207018`: device OOM
- `507010`: heartbeat lost or device abort path
- `507014`: AI Core timeout
- `507054`: HBM ECC error
- `561003`: kernel not found
- `561107`: OPP path not found
- `EI0002`: HCCL notify wait timeout
- `EI0006`: HCCL socket build timeout
- `EL0004`: OOM

## Registration and Support Checks

When an operator is reported as missing or unsupported, check in this order:

1. is the operator expected to exist on NPU at all
2. is the dispatcher or registration path present
3. is there an NPU implementation or fallback path
4. is the current PyTorch + torch_npu + CANN combination compatible

High-value routing checks:

- import failure or `symbol not found` after upgrade
  - treat as `stack-version-mismatch` first
- HCCL timeout or collective stall
  - check `distributed-communication-timeout` signals before operator logic
- CANN environment import or startup failure
  - check `missing-cann-environment` first
- OOM or allocator failure
  - treat as `device-out-of-memory` first

## Quick Route

Use this order unless the evidence clearly forces a narrower route:

1. check `reference/failure-showcase.md` for a direct stable pattern match
2. classify the strongest code family:
   - `ERRxxxx`
   - `107xxx`, `207xxx`, `507xxx`
   - `161xxx`, `361xxx`, `561xxx`
   - `EIxxxx`, `ELxxxx`, `EZxxxx`
3. decide whether the symptom is:
   - environment or version compatibility
   - operator registration or dispatcher
   - ACLNN capability or parameter contract
   - HCCL or distributed ordering
   - memory or device-health path
4. only then decide whether the issue is a real operator support gap

High-value routing shortcuts:

- `Expected all tensors to be on the same device`
  - route to device placement before operator support
- `PrivateUse1 dispatcher not registered`
  - route to dispatcher or registration before generic runtime
- `aclnnXxx` missing or `561003`
  - route to CANN capability, OPP, or version floor before registration corruption
- `EI0002`, `EI0006`, `107020`
  - route to HCCL ordering, rank progress, or timeout instead of operator logic
- `symbol not found`, ABI or import failure after upgrade
  - route to version compatibility before backend behavior

## Common Failure Classes

- operator registration gap
- dispatcher gap or `PrivateUse1` mismatch
- dtype or shape constraint mismatch
- stream or context mismatch
- backend feature gap rather than a generic runtime bug
- version skew across PyTorch, torch_npu, and CANN

## PTA Misleading Patterns

Use these checks to avoid over-calling a torch_npu operator bug:

- `Expected all tensors to be on the same device`
  - usually device placement or mixed CPU/NPU input state, not missing operator support
- `ACLNN operator not found: aclnnXxx`
  - usually CANN capability or version floor mismatch before dispatcher corruption
- shape mismatch on NPU with otherwise normal registration
  - usually broadcasting or caller preconditions, not an op-registration gap
- failures that only appear through autograd or a module wrapper
  - compare the explicit op call path before assuming the base kernel is broken
- stream or context style failures after reuse across devices
  - treat as context-lifetime or async-path issues before inferring op logic defects

Additional direction checks:

- wrapper or module failure with a clean explicit op call
  - do not call it a base kernel bug until the explicit op reproduces
- backward-only failure while forward succeeds
  - route to autograd, gradient registration, or backward-specific dtype or shape coverage first
- ACLNN interface missing on one host but not another
  - route to version floor, OPP contents, or capability drift before blaming dispatcher state
- feature-not-supported wording with a clear invalid-parameter signature
  - route to parameter contract or dtype or shape preconditions first

## Quick Contrast Checks

- explicit op call vs higher-level module or composite path
  - isolates wrapper behavior from the raw operator path
- NPU vs CPU reference behavior
  - checks whether the issue is backend-specific or a generic usage problem
- eager execution vs backward or autograd path
  - distinguishes forward-kernel issues from gradient or composite-path issues
- blocking vs default async execution
  - improves stack accuracy for delayed kernel-launch failures

Useful low-cost contrast pairs:

- explicit `torch_npu` or op call vs module or composite wrapper
- forward-only vs backward-enabled repro
- single rank vs distributed launch
- current stack vs known-compatible version matrix

## Index Linkage

Use the structured indexes after lightweight routing, not before it.
Use [cann-api-reference](cann-api-reference.md) when the route is already on
the CANN or ACLNN side and you only need index-specific interpretation.

### When to read `reference/index/cann_error_index.db`

Read it when:

- the failure has a stable CANN, ACL, HCCL, or runtime code family
- you need the direct meaning of `107xxx`, `207xxx`, `507xxx`, `EIxxxx`, `ELxxxx`, or `EZxxxx`
- you must separate parameter, runtime, and internal fault classes before proposing a fix hint

Interpretation hints:

- parameter or validation style codes
  - check shape, dtype, context, or argument contract before backend support claims
- runtime or resource style codes
  - check memory, stream, timeout, or rank progress before operator support claims
- internal or hardware style codes
  - check device health, stack compatibility, or kernel package state before blaming user code

### When to read `reference/index/cann_aclnn_api_index.db`

Read it when:

- the failure names an `aclnnXxx` interface directly
- the logs suggest a missing interface, missing kernel package, or unsupported ACLNN path
- you need to confirm whether the operator variant exists and what constraints it carries

Use it to answer:

- is this a real interface or kernel-package gap
- is the failing variant outside the current capability set
- does the API contract imply a parameter, shape, or dtype misuse

Use `scripts/query_cann_index.py` to query both DBs. If the DB index and the local evidence disagree, keep the local evidence as
primary and downgrade confidence instead of forcing the index to win.

## Upstream PyTorch Baseline

When a PTA failure depends on expected upstream operator behavior, use PyTorch
itself as the clean reference point before blaming torch_npu:

- confirm what behavior PyTorch expects from the operator on CPU or CUDA
- decide whether the failure is an NPU feature gap or a general operator misuse
- inspect the authoritative upstream signature and dispatch definition

Primary upstream sources:

- `native_functions.yaml`
- ATen native CPU implementation
- ATen CUDA implementation
- public PyTorch operator documentation

Good first comparison targets:

- `InstanceNorm`
- `GroupNorm`
- `LayerNorm`
- `Convolution`
- `Linear`

When comparing upstream expectations against NPU behavior, check:

- input rank and shape constraints
- dtype rules
- device expectations
- return type and inplace or view behavior
- backward or gradient expectations

Useful upstream search patterns:

```bash
rg -n "<op_name>" <pytorch_repo>/aten/src/ATen/native/native_functions.yaml
rg -n "<OpName>" <pytorch_repo>/aten/src/ATen/native/
rg -n "<OpName>" <pytorch_repo>/aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/
```

If the failure only appears on NPU while upstream PyTorch behavior is stable,
keep investigating torch_npu registration, support, or backend behavior rather
than re-litigating the upstream operator contract.

## Searching for Specific Operators

Useful search patterns when source is available:

```bash
find <torch_npu_repo> -name "npu_native_functions.yaml" -exec grep "<op_name>" {} +
grep -r "<OpName>" <op_plugin_repo> --include="*KernelNpuOpApi.cpp"
grep -r "<OpName>" <op_plugin_repo> --include="*KernelNpu.cpp"
```

What to look for:

- registration entry exists
- implementation exists
- op-plugin or fallback path exists
- backward rule exists when failure is grad-only

## Debugging Operator Issues

- test whether the operator exists before assuming a runtime-only issue
- inspect CANN logs for the exact failing operator path
- use `ASCEND_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` for accurate stack traces
- compare explicit operator API behavior vs autograd or composite path behavior

Common PTA-specific traps:

- CUDA-only test helpers or `_cuda_*` assumptions running on NPU
- feature gaps where an operator exists upstream but not on NPU yet
- NPU-specific alternate APIs for features like packing or quantization
- stream or context mismatch after cross-device or cross-context reuse

## GPU, CUDA, and NCCL Hints

- `CUDA out of memory`: GPU memory pressure
- `illegal address`, `launch failure`: kernel or indexing path
- `unhandled system error`, `remote process exited`, `timeout`: NCCL or distributed path

## Routing Hint

- hardware, ECC, heartbeat, or link errors -> Platform
- code, shape, or dtype misuse -> Scripts or Framework
- backend numeric or alphanumeric codes -> Backend, CANN, or ACLNN
- if a code cleanly matches a current real Factory card, prefer the card over a
  generic code-only explanation
