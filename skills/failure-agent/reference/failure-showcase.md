# Failure Showcase (Known-Issue Transition Reference)

This file is a local fallback reference for `failure-agent` when Factory cards
are unavailable or unreadable.

It is intentionally written as Markdown, but each entry mirrors the core
semantics of a Factory `known_issue` card so the content can be migrated later
with minimal reshaping.

Defaults used in this file unless a line says otherwise:

- `kind: known_issue`
- `symptom: failure`
- `lifecycle_state: stable`
- `source_kind: bootstrap`
- `confidence_level: bootstrap`

- detection_pattern: "TBE|compile failed|E9[0-9A-Z]+|EB[0-9A-Z]+|UB overflow|operator compilation"
- description: MindSpore's Ascend backend fails while compiling a TBE operator because the input shape, dtype, or backend toolchain path violates kernel-generation constraints.

- detection_pattern: "jit_view_unsupported|view|squeeze|flatten|reshape|GRAPH_MODE|graph compile"
- description: Some `mint` view-style APIs are not safe in GRAPH_MODE or JIT lowering, so code that works in eager-style execution can fail or behave incorrectly when compiled.
- fix_summary: Narrow the failing view op, compare with PyNative behavior, and replace the unsupported `mint` view path with a safer `ops.*` path or an explicitly materialized tensor.
- validation: Re-run the same logic in PyNative mode and confirm the failure is tied to the graph-compiled view path rather than to the underlying data itself.

- severity: medium
- lifecycle_state: stable
- source_kind: bootstrap

- affects_platforms: [ascend, gpu, cpu]
- detection_pattern: "GRAPH_MODE|PYNATIVE_MODE|graph only|works in PyNative|compile only"
- description: The failing logic behaves differently across Graph and PyNative mode, which usually means the first diagnosis target is frontend lowering, infer, or mode-specific API semantics instead of a generic backend bug.

- detection_pattern: "ImportError|AttributeError|module is not callable|unexpected keyword|old import path|refactor"
- description: A refactor or API move changes the import target, callable shape, or wrapper signature, so the visible failure is packaging or API drift rather than backend execution.
- fix_summary: Check the effective import target, wrapper signature, and recently moved API entrypoints before debugging runtime layers.
- validation: Print the resolved symbol and call signature, then confirm the failure disappears after switching to the current import path or callable contract.

- affects_platforms: [ascend]
- detection_pattern: "operator is called asynchronously|stacktrace may be inaccurate|ASCEND_LAUNCH_BLOCKING"
- description: torch_npu launches work asynchronously, so the visible Python stack often points to the launch site rather than the true failing device operation.
- fix_summary: Switch to a synchronous debug mode or inspect lower-level runtime logs before assuming the top stack frame is the real failure site.
- validation: Re-run with synchronous launch settings and confirm the reported failure point becomes stable and actionable.
- notes: This is often a diagnosis aid rather than the final root cause.

- detection_pattern: "207003|ACL_ERROR_RT_AICORE_OVER_FLOW|overflow|loss becomes NaN|mixed precision"
- description: Mixed-precision or fp16 execution overflows numerically, which can surface directly as an AI Core error or indirectly as downstream instability.
- fix_summary: Stabilize the hot path by casting sensitive operations to fp32, tuning loss scaling, and checking gradients for inf or nan before continuing.

- detection_pattern: "_convert_weight_to_int4pack|PrivateUse1 dispatcher not registered|int4 quantization|weight packing"
- description: The requested int4 weight-packing path is not wired up for NPU, so PyTorch dispatch falls back into an unsupported path instead of finding an NPU-specific implementation.
- fix_summary: Treat this as an operator-support gap first: use the NPU-specific weight-packing path if one exists, or fall back to a supported quantization workflow instead of assuming a generic CANN runtime bug.
- validation: Check whether the call site can be switched to a supported NPU quantization or packing path and confirm the same dispatcher error disappears.

### Mixed CPU and NPU Device Placement

- affects_platforms: [ascend]
- detection_pattern: "Expected all tensors to be on the same device|cpu and npu|device mismatch|PrivateUse1"

- affects_platforms: [ascend]
- detection_pattern: "aclnn.*not found|kernel not found|561003|feature not supported|capability mismatch"
- description: The requested ACLNN path is unavailable because the installed CANN capability set, OPP package, or version floor does not cover the operator variant being exercised.
- fix_summary: Check the CANN version, OPP path, and operator capability set before treating the symptom as dispatcher corruption or a generic runtime bug.
- validation: Compare the failing operator against the current CANN capability set and confirm the error disappears on a known-supported version or operator variant.
